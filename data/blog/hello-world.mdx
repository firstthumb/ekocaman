### Hello World ?

I have started to writing my first blog in 2006.
Just graduated and I didn't know where to go to find new techs.
There were no twitter, no youtube, no reddit and even no stackoverflow (Launched: 15 September 2008; 12 years ago).
I was trying to be up-to-date by reading javadoc, springframework docs, safari online and
other bloggers.

I am planning to write down what I am doing for future myself.
